Hey there, thanks for checking out my website!

My name's Nicholas Mosher, and I'm a Software Engineering major at the
Rochester Institute of Technology. Originally I'm from the
[Eastern Shore of Virginia](https://goo.gl/maps/vei1xRLEcWA2), where I went
to Nandua High School and participated on FRC team 1829, the Carbonauts
(coincidentally, RIT was founded in 1829, so now I have <i>twice</i> as many
shirts with that number on it now!).

As far as my technical preferences go, I'm a huge fan of Linux - my primary OS
is Ubuntu. My favorite programming languages are Java and C, for which I use
Intellij and Vim to edit, respectively. I've dabbled with quite a bit of
Android development, but now I've become more interested with the Linux,
under-the-hood side where everything feels much lower level and mysterious -
at least for the time being. I'm really into robotics, but mostly
as a hobby since it's a mix of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering
and I tend to stick to software - though in another life I could definitely see
myself becoming a mechanical engineer.

When I'm not doing work-like-productive-things, I enjoy doing
fun-but-not-necessarily-unproductive things. Growing up surrounded by water,
I've got a love for boating and watersports like skiing and wakeboarding, but
having family in the north, I found that I love snowboarding and winter sports
too! I'm hoping to find a few weekends every winter for the rest of school to
get out on the slopes.

If you're here because you're evaluating an application I filled out,
or if you're trying to reach me about a project I've done, great!
I hope you have these links already, but if not you can find my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholastmosher) and my
[GitHub](https://github.com/nicholastmosher) accounts online, you can get a
recent copy of my resume right [here](/assets/Resume.pdf), and of course, my
email is nicholastmosher@gmail.com.
